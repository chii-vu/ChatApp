This is a chat app built with React, Node.js, and MySQL. It uses Docker to run the client, server, and database in separate containers.

To run the chat app, go into the project directory and run `docker compose up`.
Three containers will be created: chatapp-node, chatapp-react, and mysql:5.7.
Nagivate to `localhost:8081` to view the app.
